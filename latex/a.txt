	The A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE) is a detector designed for heavy-ion physics at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It is primarily used to study lead-lead ($^{208}\text{Pb}$) collision and so the most severe design constraint is to being able to withstand the high charge multiplicity expected for central events. During a collision conditions similar to those just after the Big Bang are recreated, condition that may also be present in neutron stars and other astrophysical objects. The ALICE collaboration uses the 10 000-tonne ALICE detector 26 m long, 16 m high, and 16 m wide. The detector sits in a vast cavern 56 m below ground close to the village of St Genis-Pouilly in France, receiving beams from the LHC. \cite{Alice}  The aim of ALICE is to recreate and study quark-gluon plasma, which is crucial for understanding the mechanisms that confine quarks and gluons, chiral symmetry restoration and the nature of the strong nuclear force. ALICE is currently the only experiment at the LHC specifically designed to study nuclear matter produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions and the QGP. For this reason, it must be able to measure as many observables as possible by studying all the different phenomena that can be attributed to the formation of a QGP state. It can estimate parameters such as the charged multiplicity of the interactions, the impact parameter, the shape and orientation of the fireball, the collision volume and the number of nucleons interacting in the collision. Almost all known Particle IDentification (PID) techniques are used in ALICE, such as: specific energy loss (dE/dx), time-of-flight, Cherenkov radiation, electromagnetic calorimetry, muon detectors and topological reconstruction of decays. 
    Despite all these identification techniques, it's very difficult to select signals of decays of heavy flavours, as will be explain in the last section, so the acquisition of a huge amount of events with a high efficiency of the data acquisition system (up to a frequency of 1.3 GB/s) is required. 
     A sketch of the ALICE coordinate system is shown in Fig \ref{fig:ALICE_cordinates} In this figure, the (x, y, z) axes are shown together with the cylindrical coordinates used to describe the trajectory of particles in ALICE, (r, $\theta$, $\varphi$).

	The ALICE sub-detectors are categorized into two main groups: one at mid-rapidity $|\eta|$ $<$1, the central barrel, and one at forward rapidity -4 $< \eta < -2.5$, that include also the muon spectrometer for muon identification. The apparatus scheme can be resumed in the following manner.

	\subsection{Inner Tracking System (ITS)}

	The Inner Tracking System (ITS) is a crucial part of the ALICE tracking system, positioned as the innermost sub-detector of the central barrel, closest to the beam pipe and the interaction point. It consists of six concentric cylindrical layers of silicon detectors, comprising two layers each of Silicon Pixel Detector (SPD), Silicon Drift Detector (SDD), and Silicon Strip Detector (SSD). The ITS covers the pseudorapidity region |$\eta$| < 0.9 for interactions occurring within 10 cm from the detector center.
	\begin{figure}[h]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{ITS_schematic.png}
		\caption{Schematic diagram of the Inner Tracking System (ITS) of the ALICE experiment \cite{collaboration_2010}}
		\label{fig:ITS_schematic}
	\end{figure}
	The  SPD is located at radial distances of 3.9 cm and 7.6 cm from the beam pipe. These layers cover extended pseudorapidity ranges of |$\eta$| $<$ 2.0 and |$\eta$| $<$ 1.4, respectively. They consist of hybrid silicon pixel detectors, in total $9.8 \ × \ 10^6$, which generate binary signals when traversed by charged particles, facilitating their counting. The primary functions of the SPD are to determine the position of the primary vertex with a high resolution, surpassing 100 $\mu$m, to help isolate events coming from pileup, and to contribute to the triggering system due to their fast response. The SPD also contributes to achieving an impact-parameter resolution surpassing 50 $\mu$m for tracks with transverse momentum $p_\perp$ $>$ 1.3 GeV/c.
	The two intermediate layers are the SDD, situated at radii of 15.0 cm and 23.9 cm, covering |$\eta$| $<$ 0.9. The SDD has very good multi-track capability and provides two out of the four measurements of specific dE/dx employed for PID by the ITS. It provides two-dimensional spatial information (r $\phi$ and z) with a spatial resolution of 35 $\mu$m (r $\phi$) and 25 $\mu$m (z). The SDD determines particle positions using drift time estimation and charge centroid measurement and is structured with a central cathode for precise particle tracking.
	The two outermost layers employ double-sided Silicon Strip Detectors (SSD), located at radial distances of 38.0 cm and 43.0 cm, covering |$\eta$| $<$ 1.0. The SSD is essential for the prolongation of tracks from the main tracking detector of ALICE, the Time Projection Chamber (TPC), to the ITS. It provides a spatial resolution of 20 $\mu$m (r $\phi$) and 830 $\mu$m (z) and 27 $\mu$m (r $\phi$) and 830 $\mu$m (z) according to the third source, with a fast readout time of 1 $\mu$s. Besides connecting tracks, the SSD also provides dE/dx information, enabling the ITS with the standalone capability to serve as a low-pT particle spectrometer. Each SSD module consists of a 1536-strip double-sided sensor connected to twelve front-end chips that furnish position and energy deposition details.
	The primary responsibilities of the ITS include:
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item 	Reconstructing the primary vertex of collisions with a high resolution, surpassing 100 $\mu$m
    	\item 	Reconstructing the secondary vertices, points of decay for short-lived hadrons
    	\item 	Particle identification (PID) and tracking of low-momentum particles with momentum below 200 MeV/c.
    \end{itemize}
	The ITS can also perform "standalone" tracking that reconstructs charged particles in the low pT region (e.g., pions with pT $<$ 80 MeV/c) by using exclusively the information from its six planes. The high granularity of ITS allows maintaining the detector occupancy below a safe level. The good resolution of the detector allows to separate primary and secondary vertices from weak decays, hyperons, D and B mesons. The analogue readout in the four outer layers (SDD and SSD) samples the particle energy loss (dE/dx) in the material, providing information sufficient to perform PID below 700 MeV/c. %da controllare

	\subsection{Time projection chamber (TPC)}
	    The Time projection chamber is the main
       tracking detector of the central barrel. It is specifically designed for measure tracks with transverse momentum range 0.1 Gev/c $\div$ 100 Gev/c and pseudorapidity range $|\eta| \ <$ 0.9.  It is positioned at radial distances ranging from 85 to 247 cm from the beam pipe, extending along the beam direction with a total length of 510 cm. It is divided along the beam axis into two equally large drift regions by a central cathode, each having a length of 2.5 m. On the opposite sides of the central electrodes there is the readout plate, which is equipped with multi-wire proportional chambers (MWPC). Each of the 18 readout chambers covers an azimuth of $20^{\circ}$. The volume of the TPC ($\sim$ 90 $m^3$) can be filled with different gases depending on the running conditions. A graphical resume is visible in Fig \reg{fig:time_projection_chamber} The perfect candidate is a gas with a small radiation length and low multiple scattering rates, usually filled with a mixture containing various combinations of argon, neon, carbon dioxide and sometimes nitrogen. When charged particles pass through the gas, they ionise it, creating an electron-ion pair. These ionization electrons then drift towards sensing electrodes under a uniform electric field, typically achieved by applying a high voltage of around 100 kV between the central electrode and the readout plates. The ionization electrons drift with a speed of approximately 2.7 cm/s, corresponding to a maximum drift time of around 92 ms. This drift process allows spatial localisation of the ionisation event along the particle trajectory. In addition, the presence of a uniform magnetic field along the z-direction causes charged particles to bend into curved trajectories. This allows precise momentum measurements.  The position resolution for the inner/outer radii ranges from 800 to 1100 $\mu$m in the transverse plane (r $\phi$) and from 1100 to 1250 $\mu$m along the beam axis (z). The total charge collected at the end plates for each track is proportional to the particle energy loss in the gas. This allows a sampling of the dE/dx and therefore perform PID below 1 GeV/c. The resolution on the dE/dx is 5\% for isolated tracks (low multiplicity collisions), while when the number of particles increase such as Pb–Pb collisions (high multiplicity collisions), the resolution is 7\%. This is due to the increased probability to have hits close in space. In addition, the contribution of positive ions to the signal shape increases with the particle occupancy and the formation of large amount of charged particles that can induce local modifications to the external electric field modifying the drift speed and complicating the reconstruction of the track. The specific energy loss can be described by the Bethe-Bloch formula, which depends on the particle species, it momentum, and the properties of the traversed medium. It can be estimate in the following manner proposed by \cite{Rolandi:2008ujz}.
	 \begin{equation}
	 	f(\beta) = \frac{P_1}{\beta^{P_4}} \left(P_2 - \beta^{P_4} -ln(P_3) \frac{1}{(\beta \gamma)^{P_5}} \right)
	 \end{equation}
	 Where $\beta$ is the particle velocity in c unit, $\gamma$ the Lorentz factor, $P_{1-5}$ free parameter that must be estimate from data.

	 \subsection{Time Of Flight (TOF)}
	 The Time Of Flight (TOF) detector is a large array of Multi-gap Resistive-Plate Chambers (MRPC), located at 3.7 m and 3.99 m radial distance, respectively, from the interaction point. It is designed to identify charged particle produced in pseudorapidity of $|\eta|$ $<$ 0.9 and with an intermediate momentum range (0.5 $<$ $p_\perp$ $<$ 4 GeV/c). In addition TOF has been used to provide a trigger specific for cosmic ray and Ultra Peripheral Collision UPC events. The TOF detector has a modular structure divided along the azimuthal direction into 18 super modules as visible in Fig \ref{fig::TOF}. If a particle ionizes the gas in the detector, an avalanche process will be triggered to generate signal on the readout electrodes. Particle identification is performed by combining the information bring by the linear momentum module (p) and track length (l) with the measurement of the time of flight (t) in TOF. The mass (m) corresponding to the one of the detected particle can be obtained. 
	 \begin{equation}
	 	p = m \gamma \beta c \leftarrow \rightarrow m = \frac{p \sqrt{1- \beta^2}}{c \beta} = \frac{p \sqrt{\frac{1}{\beta^2}-1}}{c}
	 \end{equation} 
	 The $\beta$ parameter can be measured in the following manner
	 \begin{equation}
	 	\beta = \frac{v}{c}=\frac{l}{c \ t}
	 \end{equation}
	 So 
	 \begin{equation}
	 	m = \frac{p \sqrt{\left( \frac{t}{l c} \right)^2-1}}{c}
	 \end{equation}
	 Studying the equation became clear that, at large momenta, the resolution on the track momentum ($\sigma_p$) becomes negligible and the total uncertainty is driven by the uncertainties on the timing ($\sigma_t$) and track length ($\sigma_l$). For these reason the TOF detector was designed to achieve a timing resolution better than 40 ps with a detector efficiency close to 100\%.

     \subsubsection{Transition Radiation Detector (TRD)}
	  The Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) is positioned between the TPC and TOF detector and it covers a pseudorapidity range of $|\eta|\ <$ 0.84. It is principally use for electron identification in high momentum region (p $>$ 1 GeV), where discriminating between electrons and pions using traditional dE/dx techniques becomes challenging. When charged particles attempt to cross the detector, pass through two media with different dielectric constants emitting so transition radiation with an intensity proportional to their Lorentz factor. Since different particles have different masses and velocities, they emit different amounts of transition radiation making the identification possible.
 \cite{Padhan:2924203} \cite{amsdottorato9036}
	  
	  \subsubsection{Photon Spectrometer (PHOS)}
	  The Photon Spectrometer (PHOS) it's an electromagnetic calorimeter known for its  high spatial and energy resolution thanks to a scintillating material called Lead Tungstate ($PbWO_4$). It covers a pseudo-rapidity range of $ |\eta|\ <$ 0.12 with a dynamic energy range from 0.1 GeV to 100 GeV. Its main goal is to measure QGP temperature, space-time dimensions and study deconfinement through jet quenching. \cite{Padhan:2924203} \cite{amsdottorato9036}
	  
	  \subsubsection{High-Momentum Particle Identification Detector (HMPID)}
 	The High Momentum Particle Identification Detector (HMPID) is dedicated to the identification of charged hadrons with $p_\perp \ >$ 1 GeV/c, thus extending the PID capabilities of the ITS, TPC and TOF at high momentum. It cover a pseudorapidity range of -0.6 $< \ \eta \ < $ 0.6 and consist mainly of two parts: the radiator and the photon detector composed by seven Ring Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) counters. \cite{Padhan:2924203} \cite{amsdottorato9036}
    
 	\subsubsection{Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMCaL)}
		The EMCal consists of towers of 6 × 6 × 20 $cm^3$ each, made up of 76 alternating layers of lead and scintillator (not uniform, unlike PHOS). It was designed to measure electrons from the decay of heavy flavour hadrons, but not only. It also identifies high-energy particles and enhances energy resolution across various momenta, enabling precise measurements of jet quenching, high-energy jets, and high-momentum electrons and photons.\cite{Padhan:2924203} \cite{Arata:2922803}
	
	\subsection{Forward Detectors}
	\subsubsection{VZERO detector (V0)} 
	The V0 detector consists of two circular arrays of scintillator counters (named V0A and V0C) one per side with asymmetric distance from the interaction point. The V0A covers the pseudorapidity region 2.8 $\ <\ \eta \ <$ 5.1 while V0C -3.7 $<\ \eta \ <$ -1.7. They are important both in pp collision and AA collision for the following reason;
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Triggering}: The V0 detector provides a minimum bias trigger signal. This is important because help to detect a broad range of inelastic collision events without introducing significant selection bias.
		\item \textbf{Rejection background events}: The VZERO detector help in the rejection of background events generated due to the interaction of beams with residual gas within the beam pipe and with mechanical structures. This is possible thanks to the time gap between signals from V0A and V0C.
		\item \textbf{Centrality determination}: The signal given by the V0 detector is proportional to
		the number of particles traversing it furnishing information about the multiplicity and centrality of the collision. This data are precious for understanding the collision geometry and interpreting experimental results accurately.
	\end{itemize}
	 \cite{Padhan:2924203} \cite{amsdottorato9036}	
	
	\subsubsection{T0 Detectors}
	The T0 detector consists of two arrays, T0A and T0C, of Cherenkov counters placed along the beam pipe on each side of the interaction point, respectively at -72.7 cm and 375 cm.  The pseudorapidity coverage are	4.61 $<\ \eta\ <$ 4.92 (T0A) and -3.28 $<\ \eta\ <$ -2.97 (T0C). Its primary function is to provide a fast timing signal for the TOF detector, serving as a collision time reference. It can be also use for an independent determination of the vertex position along the beam axis (with a precision of $\pm$ 1.5 cm). \cite{Padhan:2924203} \cite{amsdottorato9036}	
	
	\subsubsection{Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC)}
	The Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) consists of four calorimeters, two for protons (brass-quartz proton ZP) and two for neutrons (tungsten-quartz neutron ZN), on each side. located at $\sim$ 112.5 cm away from the interaction point,	symmetrically in both directions. The ZDC measures the energy of the spectator nucleons and assists in the estimation of centrality and luminosity in heavy ion collisions by determining the collision geometry, overlap regions of the colliding nuclei and the number of participating nucleons.\cite{Padhan:2924203} \cite{amsdottorato9036}	
	
	\subsubsection{Muon Spectrometer}
	The muon spectrometer is located 14 m in the negative beam direction and cover a pseudorapidity range of 4 $<\ \eta\ <$ 2.5. It help to studies the complete spectrum of heavy quarkonia via their decay in the $\mu^+ \mu^-$ channel. It is composed of different part. The particles cross first an absorber, mainly composed of carbon and concrete, designed to absorb the hadrons emerging from the interaction point. This material choice is for limit the multiple scattering and the energy loss of the muons. The muons then traverse five tracking stations and are deflected by the magnetic field allowing for the determination of their momentum. The dipole magnet is positioned at about 7 m from the interaction providing a magnetic field nominally of B = 0.7 T but can be changed by the requirements on the mass resolution. The next part is the muon filter, an iron wall designed to reduce the background in the trigger chambers by absorbing secondary hadrons and low momentum muons. Finally, the muons reach the trigger system, which consists of two stations equipped with resistive plate chambers characterised by a time resolution of about 1 ns.

	\subsection{Track and vertex reconstruction} 
	
	The purpose of tracking algorithms \cite{Cheng:2908766} is to use the the cluster information transforming them into track information, obtaining the best possible approximation of the real trajectory of the particles crossing the detector. process that uses the Kalman filter algorithm to accurately determine the trajectory of particles as they pass through the detector layers. The tracking procedure starts with the clusterization step. Starting from the collected raw data, from each detector, the data cluster are produced. The cluster correspond to groups of hits produced by a single particle interaction with a detector element and contain his positions, signal amplitude, signal times, and their associated errors. The clusterization is performed separately for each detector. The reconstruction of the primary vertex is an essential step, as it is referred to the interaction point. Usually, each collision event only involves one primary interaction point, and numerous tracks traverse the detectors. In this ambitious the information provided by the SPD detector plays a crucial role in establishing a preliminary interaction vertex. This is the space point that minimises the distance among the tracklets, which are the track segments reconstructed by associating pairs of clusters in the two SPD layers. So is possible to localize the vertex searching  the point where most of the tracklets converge. In high multiplicity events the algorithm is repeated several times, discarding at each iteration those clusters which contributed to already found vertices. The tracking algorithm can be separated into two steps: the track finding and the track fitting. For the track finding, two methods are used. The first one is called Linear Track Finder (LTF) and it looks for cluster position aligned along a straight line. However the magnetic field curve the trajectory of charged particle but the deviation can be neglected at least at hight $p_\perp$ hence supporting the choice of a LTF for such tracks. For help in these work a radial tolerance Rcut is given, a graphical resume is visible in Fig \ref{fig:linear_track} . If a track had been recognized in the previous step the correspondent cluster are removed from the list of available clusters considered in the further steps. The next step consist on a Cellular Automaton (CA) approach particularly suited for low-momentum tracks, sensitive to multiple scatterings. It is based on a propagation and joining of “segments”. A segment is a portion of line connecting two clusters from two consecutive disks: So starting from a given segment, considered as the first, the algorithm search the further one towards imposing track continuity conditions. The strategist is visible in Fig \ref{fig:CA_track}. Tracks are only accepted if they have at least 20 associated clusters (out of a possible 159) and have missed fewer than 50\% of the expected clusters. Only after that the track candidates are found a track fitting algorithm is applied in order to extract the kinematic parameters of each track. It is able to determine the spatial and momentum coordinates considering material effects, updates the parameters based on measurement. The process is repeated for each track cluster \cite{Herrmann:2920632}.
