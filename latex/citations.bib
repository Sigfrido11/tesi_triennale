	author = {H {David Politzer}},
	abstract = {The discovery of asymptotic freedom has opened up the possibility of extracting new sorts of detailed, dynamical consequences from a strongly interacting quantum field theory. The necessary tools - perturbation theory, the renormalization group, gauge theories, and the operator product expansion - are not new. To anyone familiar with these field theoretic approaches to strong interactions, the novel feature is a simple fact: there is a unique class of theories in which “the origin is an ultraviolet fixed point”. But the consequences are so exciting that it seemed appropriate to review these ideas as they reflect on each other. Many important applications of the renormalization group and the operator product expansion to hadronic physics are omitted; the emphasis here is on recent work based on asymptotically free field theories. No doubt, there are some developments so recent that they are not treated in this article. The discussion of the basic results concerning short distance behavior is informal, but, hopefully, accurate and complete. The specific applications are treated in varying detail.}

	abstract = {One of the fundamental questions in the field of subatomic physics is the question of what happens to matter at extreme densities and temperatures as may have existed in the first microseconds after the Big Bang and exists, perhaps, in the core of dense neutron stars. The aim of heavy-ion physics is to collide nuclei at very high energies and thereby create such a state of matter in the laboratory. The experimental program began in the 1990s with collisions made available at the Brookhaven Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) and the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS), and continued at the Brookhaven Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) with the maximum center-of-mass energies of , 17.2 and 200 GeV, respectively. Collisions of heavy ions at the unprecedented energy of 2.76 TeV recently became available at the LHC collider at CERN. In this review, I give a brief introduction to the physics of ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions and discuss the current status of elliptic flow measurements.}
